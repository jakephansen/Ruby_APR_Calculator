To Run Program:
1. Type in ruby program.rb in command-line
2. Follow commands when prompted, making sure to spell things correctly

Please Note:
1. You can display the balance for any given day, using the "Show_Balance" option,
but the program can't go "back in time". For example, in the first test-cast
scenario where 500 is charged Day 1, if you display a date for more 30 or more
days after the account was created, and then try to display a date from the first
30 days, the result will be inaccurate. If you start with the earliest day first,
however, the results will be correct.

2. The Card numbers are 1001 and 1002 for the testing data, and as you create
new accounts they will increase by 1.

3. The "Display_Data" option will include a balance, but that balance is only up-to-date
with the last_updated_date, so if you want to check a specific date, use the
"Show_Balance".


Thank you for your time and consideration!
